## Installation

### Prerequisites
- [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) installed
- A terminal that supports 256 colors

### Manual Installation

1. Download the theme file:
```bash
curl -o ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/vibrant.zsh-theme https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-username/vibrant/main/vibrant.zsh-theme
```

2. Set the theme in your `~/.zshrc`:
```bash
ZSH_THEME="vibrant"
```

3. Reload your shell:
```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Alternative Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/vibrant.git
cd vibrant
```

2. Copy the theme to your Oh My Zsh themes directory:
```bash
cp vibrant.zsh-theme ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/
```

3. Update your `~/.zshrc` and reload:
```bash
echo 'ZSH_THEME="vibrant"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

## Configuration

The theme works out of the box with no additional configuration required. However, you can customize the behavior:

### Conda Integration
The theme automatically detects and displays conda environments. If you prefer conda's default prompt, you can disable the custom conda display by setting:
```bash
export CONDA_CHANGEPS1=true
```

## Compatibility

- **Oh My Zsh**: All versions
- **Zsh**: 5.0+
- **Terminal**: Any terminal with 256-color support

## Troubleshooting

### Colors not displaying correctly
Ensure your terminal supports 256 colors. Test with:
```bash
curl -s https://gist.githubusercontent.com/HaleTom/89ffe32783f89f403bba96bd7bcd1263/raw/ | bash
```

### Git status not showing
Make sure you're in a git repository and git is properly installed:
```bash
git --version
git status
```

### Conda environment not displaying
Verify conda is activated and `CONDA_DEFAULT_ENV` is set:
```bash
echo $CONDA_DEFAULT_ENV
```
